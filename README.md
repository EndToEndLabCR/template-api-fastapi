## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Prerequisites

All core services and dependencies are containerized, so you only need the following installed on your local machine to run the project:

- Docker – For building and running containers
- Flyway – Optional locally, but included in the container setup for database migrations
- Git – To clone the repository and manage version control

All other components—Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Gunicorn, and PostgreSQL—are pre-configured and run inside the container.
No need to install them globally.

### 💾 Installation

Create a fork of this repository.

Then:

```sh
# Clone the repository in your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/template-api-fastapi.git
cd template-api-fastapi
```

### 🏃 Running the App

- Create the pip environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

- Activate the pip environment:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Update pip (optional-recommended):

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

- Install the project's dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Deactivate virtual environment:

```sh
deactivate
```

### Docker

Run locally using Docker:

- Delete any containers to avoid cache (no required if it is the first time running this project):

```sh
docker compose down
```

- Build the project:

```sh
docker compose up
```

## 👾 Usage

- If everything runs smoothly, you’ll see your containers up and running, ready to serve your backend.

- Once the containers are running, navigate to <http://localhost:8080/docs> to access the auto-generated OpenAPI interface and interact with the API endpoints.

## 📝 Configuration

Here’s what your .env file should look like with the required variables:
- Example:
```sh
  APP_ENV=local

  POSTGRES_DB_HOST=postgres
  POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5432
  POSTGRES_DB_NAME=template-api-fastapi
  POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME=admin
  POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=password
```
